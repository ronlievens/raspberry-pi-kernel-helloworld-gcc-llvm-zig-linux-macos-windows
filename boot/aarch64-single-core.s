    mrs     x4, mpidr_el1 // This reads from the mpidr_el1 system register into the x4 general purpose register. mpidr_el1 holds the Multiprocessor Affinity Register, which provides information about the processor in a multiprocessor system.
    and     x4, x4, #3    // This performs a bitwise AND operation between the value in x4 and the literal 3 (#3 in assembly denotes a literal constant), storing the result back into x4. This operation is useful in clearing bits â€” in this case, all but the least significant two bits in x4 (corresponding to the processor ID) will be cleared or set to 0.
    cbz     x4, _init     // This stands for "Compare and Branch if Zero." It checks if x4 is zero, and if so, it jumps to _init label (which is not shown in this snippet). This is often used to do some initial setup for the first processor (cpu0) in a multi-core system (like AArch64).
0:  wfe                   // This is a label followed by the wfe instruction, which stands for "Wait For Event." The processor enters a low-power sleep state until it receives an interrupt. If an event or an interrupt happens, it starts executing the instructions following it.
    b       0b            // In this line, b is an unconditional branch instruction. The processor jumps to the instruction at the label 0. In this case, it is creating an infinite loop that keeps the processor in a low-power state if it's not the one intended to perform the _init step.

_init:
    // -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // Setup the stack.
    // -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ldr     x5, =_start   // This instruction loads the address of the _start label into the x5 register. The _start label typically denotes the entry point of a program, where execution should begin.
    mov     sp, x5        // This instruction moves the value stored in the x5 register to the stack pointer register (sp). The stack pointer is a special register which points to the top of the current stack in memory -- the place where local variables (for calls and interrupts) get stored

    // -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // Clear out bss.
    // -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ldr     x5, =__bss_start   // The address of __bss_start is loaded into x5. __bss_start is a symbol that may be provided by the linker script, it's the starting address of a BSS section in memory. The BSS section is used for variables that were declared without a value and will be initialized with zero before the program starts executing.
    ldr     w6, =__bss_size    // The value of __bss_size is loaded into w6. __bss_size represents the size of BSS section.
1:  cbz     w6, 2f             // This compares w6 (the size of the BSS) to zero, if it is zero, it branches (jumps) to label 2f. If it is not zero, it continues execution with the next instruction.
    str     xzr, [x5], #8      // This stores the value in xzr register (which is always zero) into the memory location pointed to by x5 (which is __bss_start). After storing, x5 is post-incremented by 8. This is assumed to be 64-bit memory operation, so 8 bytes are cleared in BSS section.
    sub     w6, w6, #1         // This subtracts 1 from w6 and stores the result back to w6.
    cbnz    w6, 1b             // This compares w6 to zero, if it is not zero, it branches (jumps) back to label 1b. In other words, if there are still elements left to initialize (since w6 is being decremented), it continues the loop.

    // -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // Call kernel_main
    // -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2:  bl      kernel_main   // The bl instruction stands for "Branch with Link". It calls the subroutine at the address labeled kernel_main. The bl instruction also stores the return address into the lr (link register), so once kernel_main finishes execution and a return instruction (ret) is called in kernel_main, execution will continue at the point right following this bl instruction.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// halt
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
halt:
    wfe                   // This stands for "Wait For Event." The processor that executes this instruction enters a low-power sleep state until some event occurs, like an interrupt. This is used here to halt the processor in an energy-efficient manner.
    b halt                // This is an unconditional branch instruction that jumps back to the halt label, effectively creating an infinite loop. In short, once this loop is entered, the processor will continually halt and wait for an event, then halt again, indefinitely.
